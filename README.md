# Freenet

Freenet is a platform for censorship-resistant communication and publishing. It is peer-to-peer
software which provides a distributed, encrypted, decentralized datastore. Websites and applications
providing things like forums and chat are built on top of it.

Fred stands for Freenet REference Daemon.
